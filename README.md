# project-Used-Car-Prices-through-Visualization-and-ML
**Introduction**
This project focuses on analyzing the used car prices dataset, performing data cleaning, visualization and applying machine learning methods to predict the car prices by using various features.

**Dataset**

**Source**- This dataset contains information about used car including the prices,  mileage, fule type, city and year of manufacture.
**Data Cleaning** = converted the car price from string format including 'Rs', 'Lakh' and 'crore' to numeric values. converted kms driven to numeric values. cleaned up the fuel type variable and remove duplicate entries.
**EDA**- Data visualization are done on the basis of various features like: histogram, countplots, bar plots and Heatmap.
**Machine Learning**- Two types of machine learning techniques are used to analyze the model. Linear regression and Random Forest model by splitting the data in training and train dataset. Data are evaluated using the metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared, and Explained Variance Score. And finally visualize the actual and predicted data using scatter plot.
